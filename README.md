Shack (PLEASE IGNORE)
=====================

These are the first scraps of code pulled together from former
projects into a prototype shack controller for RemoteRadio
implemented in Elixir/Nerves.   

Previous projects were implemented in Python

## Current Status

Noting worth seeing here yet, I'm just getting some old code put together. 

It likely doesn't even compile yet.
